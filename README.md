# USB_2_TTL Converter
 Altium Pcb Files for USB-TTL Converter <br/>
 This is my first Altium Project all footprint library and pcb design was created by me but i used a youtube video for circuit diagram Here is the link: <br/>

 ### Information about PCB:
 I tried to use as little vias as possible to avoid signal noise <br/>
 5V Power Nets are drawn by 0.6mm line and polygon pour to avoid overheating problems <br/>
 Signal nets have 0.3mm width to draw max 1A by the standard 1oz copper option <br/>
 I tried to keep apart Signal Nets and power nets away due to they can interfere with each other <br/>
 And finally top and bottom layers are covered GND, again to avoid noise <br/>
