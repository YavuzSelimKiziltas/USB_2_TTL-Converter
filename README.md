# USB_2_TTL Converter
 Altium Pcb Files for USB-TTL Converter <br/>
 This is my first Altium Project all footprint library and pcb design was created by me but i used a youtube video for circuit diagram Here is the link: <br/>

 ### Information about PCB:
 I tried to use as little vias as possible to avoid signal noise <br/>
 5V Power Nets are drawn by 0.6mm line and polygon pour to avoid overheating problems <br/>
 Signal nets have 0.3mm width to draw max 1A by the standard 1oz copper option <br/>
 I tried to keep apart Signal Nets and power nets away due to they can interfere with each other <br/>
 And finally top and bottom layers are covered GND, again to avoid noise <br/>
 
 ### Used Materials:
 1 x 10ÂµF C1206 SMD Capacitor <br/>
 2 x 22pF C1206 SMD Capacitor <br/>
 4 x 100nF C1206 SMD Capacitor <br/>
 4 x 1.5kOhm R1206 SMD Resistor <br/> 
 3 x LED 0603 SMD Led <br/>
 1 x 12MHz HC49 Through Hole Crystal <br/>
 1 x CH340G MicroController <br/>
 1 x 6 Male Header  <br/>
